## Introduction

Traditional AI art generation techniques often lack the fluidity and responsiveness required for real-time dynamic painting. ArtCLIP addresses this gap by integrating CLIP with an attention-based fusion mechanism. This novel approach allows for real-time modulation of brushstrokes and dynamic adaptation to evolving textual prompts and visual cues, making it a groundbreaking step in AI-assisted artistic processes.

Key highlights:
- Real-time response to textual descriptions.
- Dynamic adjustment of brushwork styles.
- Enhanced interpretative flexibility for creative tasks.

## Features

- **Dynamic Freehand Painting**: Generate brushstrokes in real-time with adaptive styles.
- **Text-Visual Alignment**: Utilize CLIPâ€™s capabilities to align artistic outputs with textual prompts.
- **Attention Fusion Mechanism**: Seamlessly integrates visual and textual inputs for fluid creative expression.
- **Enhanced Artistic Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of painting styles and interpretive directions.

## Installation

To use ArtCLIP, follow these steps:
